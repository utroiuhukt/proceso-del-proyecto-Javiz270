# Was the hackers' action correct according to utilitarianism?

From a utilitarian perspective, which evaluates actions based on whether they generate the greatest amount of happiness or the least amount of suffering for the greatest number of people, the hackers' leak of the Ashley Madison data could be considered correct.

## Arguments in favor of the hackers' action.

1. **Exposure of fraudulent practices**.  
   The platform itself profited from deception, not only promoting infidelity but also exploiting its users through fraudulent practices, such as:
   - Creating fake profiles.
   - Charging fees for deleting data that they ultimately did not delete.  
   This conduct harmed both users and those indirectly affected, such as the partners and families of those who used the site. By exposing this corruption, the hackers revealed deceptive practices that could have continued indefinitely, harming more people.

2. **Positive impact on justice and accountability**.  
   - The action revealed the hypocrisy of CEO Noel Biderman, who preached monogamy while betraying his own marriage.  
   - It showed how the platform profited from people's vulnerability.  
   - It forced a public debate on ethics, privacy and the responsibility of tech companies.

## Considerations on the suffering caused

The individual suffering caused by the leak cannot be ignored, which included:
- Family breakups.
- Suicides related to the exposure of personal information.  

However, a utilitarian analysis considers the overall long-term benefits, such as reducing systemic deception and preventing future harm to other users.

## Conclusion

Although the immediate effects of the hackers' actions caused pain to many people, the collective benefits in terms of justice and social awareness outweighed the costs. From a utilitarian point of view, the decision was correct.
