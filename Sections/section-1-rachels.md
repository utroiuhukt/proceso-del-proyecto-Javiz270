# Ethical Dilemma: The Case of Baby Theresa

In *Introduction to Moral Philosophy* by James Rachels, the case of Baby Theresa, an infant born with **anencephaly**, is presented as a profound ethical dilemma. Anencephaly is a severe congenital condition that prevents the development of a functional brain, leaving the child without the capacity for consciousness, thought, or feeling. Theresa’s parents, recognizing the inevitability of her death, sought to donate her organs to other children in need. However, their request was denied due to legal restrictions in Florida, which required that Theresa be officially declared deceased before organ donation could occur. This case raises critical questions about the nature of life, morality, and the intersection of law and ethics.

## Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Value

A central concept explored in this case is the distinction between **intrinsic** and **extrinsic** value:

- **Intrinsic value** refers to the inherent worth of something, independent of its utility or consequences.  
- **Extrinsic value** is derived from the benefits or outcomes it produces.  

In Theresa’s case, her life lacked intrinsic value because she was incapable of experiencing consciousness, relationships, or any form of meaningful existence. However, her life could have held significant extrinsic value if her organs had been donated to save other children. This raises the question: *Should the value of a life be determined solely by its intrinsic qualities, or should its potential to contribute to the well-being of others also be considered?*

## Conflicting Moral Principles

The dilemma surrounding Baby Theresa highlights a tension between two fundamental moral principles:

1. **The Principle of Respect for Persons**:  
   Rooted in Kantian ethics, this principle asserts that individuals should never be treated merely as means to an end but always as ends in themselves. In Theresa’s case, some might argue that donating her organs would reduce her to a mere instrument for the benefit of others, violating her dignity as a human being.

2. **The Principle of Utility**:  
   Central to utilitarianism, this principle advocates for actions that maximize overall well-being and minimize harm. From this perspective, donating Theresa’s organs would be morally justified, as it would save multiple lives without causing her harm, given her lack of consciousness.

These principles are not easily reconciled, and the case forces us to grapple with the question of which moral framework should take precedence in such unique and tragic circumstances.

## Personal Reflection: Flexibility in Morality

Personally, I believe that morality should not be rigid or one-size-fits-all but should instead adapt to the complexities of individual cases. In Theresa’s situation, her lack of consciousness and the inevitability of her death make the argument for organ donation compelling. By donating her organs, her parents could have transformed a tragic situation into one of hope and life for others, without infringing on Theresa’s rights or dignity. This suggests that ethical decision-making should consider both the context and the potential consequences of an action, rather than adhering strictly to abstract principles.

## Law vs. Ethics: A Necessary Dialogue

The case of Baby Theresa also underscores the tension between **legal standards** and **ethical considerations**. While laws are designed to provide clear guidelines and protect societal interests, they often struggle to account for exceptional cases like Theresa’s. The legal requirement that a person must be declared deceased before organ donation can occur is rooted in the need to prevent abuse and ensure consent. However, in cases like Theresa’s, where the outcome is certain and the potential benefit to others is immense, such laws may inadvertently hinder morally justifiable actions.

This raises an important question: *Should legal systems incorporate more flexibility to address ethically complex situations?* Perhaps it is time for society to engage in a broader conversation about how laws can better reflect our collective moral intuitions, particularly in cases involving extraordinary circumstances.

## Broader Implications

The ethical dilemmas presented by Baby Theresa’s case extend beyond organ donation. They touch on broader issues such as:

- The **definition of life** and the criteria for **personhood**.  
- The role of **autonomy** in medical decision-making.  
- The balance between **individual rights** and the **greater good**.  

For instance, should the ability to experience consciousness be a prerequisite for moral consideration? How should society balance the rights of individuals with the greater good? These questions challenge us to rethink our assumptions about morality and the values that underpin our legal and ethical systems.

## Conclusion

The case of Baby Theresa serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities inherent in moral philosophy. It forces us to confront difficult questions about the value of life, the principles that guide our decisions, and the relationship between law and ethics. While there are no easy answers, engaging with such dilemmas encourages us to reflect on our values and strive for a more compassionate and nuanced approach to ethical decision-making. Ultimately, cases like Theresa’s remind us that morality is not just about following rules but about making thoughtful, empathetic choices in the face of life’s most challenging situations.
